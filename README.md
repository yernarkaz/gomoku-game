# Gomoku game - coding practice

# Wiki
Gomoku is a traditional Japanese board game for 2 players that is similar to but more complex than tic-tac-toe. During the game, players take turns placing black and white pieces on the board with the goal of creating an unbroken line of 5 pieces in any direction. A traditional Gomoku board has a 15x15 grid of lines, but is sometimes played on a Go board, which has a 19x19 grid.

# Setting up and starting the game

1. Divide the black and white pieces evenly between both players. Gomoku is played with round black and white pieces known as stones. One player should get all the black pieces while the other player gets all the white pieces.
Gomoku pieces are the same as Go pieces. Although the games themselves are different, you can play Gomoku using a Go set if you’d like.

2. Start the game by playing a black stone. By convention, the player using the black stones opens the game by placing one of their pieces on the board. Stones are placed on the intersections created by the board’s grid of lines (rather than inside the squares). In standard Gomoku, you can place your stone on any intersection you choose during your turn.
Once you place a piece on the intersection, it cannot be moved for the rest of the game.
With this standard game beginning, it has been mathematically proven that black can always win if they play optimally. However, in real life gameplay, different skill levels between players often lead to different outcomes.

3. Alternate turns between players. During the game, the two players alternate turns, with each player placing one of their stones on the board during their turn. After the first player plays a black stone, the second player will play a white stone.
During Gomoku tournaments, turn length is usually measured using chess clocks. The time limit for most tournaments is 10 minutes total per player for each game.

4. Aim for 5 pieces in a row to win the game. To win, you must be the first player to create an unbroken line of 5 of your stones. The line can go in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
While rules sometimes vary, the standard variation of Gomoku specifies that winning lines must be exactly 5 stones and no more. Rows of 6 or more pieces are called “overlines” and do not count.
